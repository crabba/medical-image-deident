# Medical Image De-Identification Workshop

## Introduction

In this workshop we will be using machine learning (ML) services to identify and remove protected health information (PHI) from the pixels of medical images.  While medical image file formats such as DICOM also store PHI as metadata within the file itself, we will not be addressing the metadata within this workshop.

In Module 1 we will deploy and run a fully-integrated Python solution that detects and redacts PHI in images stored in an S3 bucket.  This solution is run as a pre-supplied Jupyter notebook running on a SageMaker instance, using the Boto3 Python SDK to call the ML services.  

In Module 2 we will deploy an API-based solution exposing six endpoints, each of which runs one or more steps in the masking process.  This solution is fronted by API Gateway and Lambda, with the same ML services providing the text extraction and recognition, and is deployed by a CloudFormation template.

With both solutions weâ€™ll enforce security by setting up some necessary permissions using Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies and roles.
